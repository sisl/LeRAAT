**Important**

The scenario files for the Toliss A320 were generated for the version 1.0.4 of the plugin and might not work properly with newer versions of the plugin. However, they can easily be regenerated for newer versions of the plugin by loading the old scenarios, re-configuring the failures, and saving the scenario files again.
